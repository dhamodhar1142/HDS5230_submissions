        "In this assignment, I am tasked with using a genetic algorithm to select 8 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) from a given dataset to introduce specialized mental health services. After considering two possible approaches for determining the fitness of a location, I have chosen to focus on the population density within a 30-mile radius of each FQHC.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two approaches were considered for determining the fitness of the FQHC locations. The first approach, Average Closeness to All Residents, aimed to select FQHCs based on their proximity to all residents, assuming that reducing the average distance between residents and FQHCs would improve accessibility. While this method could optimize geographic distribution, it doesnâ€™t necessarily maximize the number of people served, which is a crucial factor when expanding access to specialized services like mental health care. The second approach, Population Density within 30 Miles, selects FQHCs located in areas with the highest number of residents within a 30-mile radius. I chose this approach because it directly aligns with the objective of maximizing the number of individuals who can access mental health services. The assumption is that by focusing on FQHCs with high population density, we can ensure that a larger number of people will benefit from the new services.\n",
        "\n",
        "The rationale for choosing population density lies in the goal of maximizing the reach and impact of specialized mental health services. Serving a larger population increases the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery. I believe that selecting locations with higher population density will ensure we are meeting the needs of the most people. The fitness calculation, based on the number of residents within a 30-mile radius, assumes that more residents in proximity to an FQHC increase the potential for the FQHC to provide a meaningful impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fitness function is designed to evaluate the \"fitness\" of each selection of 8 FQHC locations. The metric used is the number of residents within a 30-mile radius of each selected FQHC. For each selection of FQHCs, I compute the total population within this radius, which forms the basis for evaluating the suitability of each set of locations."
